# goRo-game
This repository hosts a roguelike using [goRo](https://github.com/kettek/goro).

## Build steps

For a quick, terminal-only build:

```
go build -tags disableEbiten
```

For a bloated build:
```
go build
```

For a graphical build (that is not implemented yet):

```
go build -tags disableTCell
```

wow!
